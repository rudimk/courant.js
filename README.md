# courant.js
Experiments with using Javascript for mathematical and scientific computing, in conjunction with languages like Python and Julia.

##..wtf?
Yeah, it's sort of picking up where I left off with [jsmath](https://github.com/rudimk/jsmath). The [talk](https://hasgeek.tv/jsfoo/2014-2/1000-javascript-and-mathematical-computing-across-servers-and-clients) was well-received, but I never really played with it after that. Well, here goes.

## Okay, really, what is courant.js?
It's definitely not a library. More like a blog of sorts, with experimental models written in Javascript, utilizing Javascript libraries as well as making use of packages written in Python and Julia, two of the best scientific computing languages ever(IMO). Think of this as a whacked-out initiative to track Javascript's use-cases for math and science.

## When's it happening?
As and when I get a breather, old boy.

##.."courant.js?"
Yep. The Courant Institute in New York happens to be one of the best centres for mathematical research. A lot of mathematicians whose work I'm interested in have been based out of there, and it's the place for areas like game theory and algebraic topology - areas I'm interested in too. So..
